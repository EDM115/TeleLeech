# TeleLeech
## [WIP] Bot written from scratch that uploads content to telegram

### I willstart to work on it when my exams will be done (probably by the end of June)

### Features :
+ Only leech for the moment (because TD are gone)
+ No filesize limit (except the server limit)
+ Pyrogram v2 based
+ No heroku ban possible (dockerization at its maximum)
+ Fastest as possible (say `hello` to âœ¨optimizationâœ¨)
+ Easy to understand + `min` version for deployment written in 6 files or less
+ Auto transload
+ Auto bypass links
+ Dump + PM
+ Will include support through my other bots (unarchive, â€¦)
+ Complete settings menu
+ Webpage (no Telegram mandatory)
+ [gimme more ideas ðŸ¥²](../../issues)
